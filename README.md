# Questions for Day 19 â€“ (07/09/2024)
## DSA:
**Question 1:** 
Given an undirected graph, find the shortest reach (in terms of the number of edges) from a starting node to all other nodes using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
##### Inputs:
- The number of nodes and edges in the graph.
- A list of edges.
- The starting node.
##### Output:
- The shortest reach to each node from the starting node.
<br>

**Question 2:** 
Implement a function to perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on a graph.
##### Inputs:
- The number of nodes and edges in the graph.
- A list of edges.
- The starting node.
##### Output:
- The nodes visited in DFS order.

## WEB-DEV:
Today, we will work on SQL queries involving table joins and data manipulation in the employees and departments tables.

### Notes:
1. **Create the employees table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    dept_id INT NOT NULL
);
```

2. **Insert dummy data into employees table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (emp_name, salary, dept_id) VALUES
('Alice Johnson', 60000.00, 1),
('Bob Smith', 55000.00, 2),
('Charlie Brown', 70000.00, 1),
('Diana Lee', 65000.00, 3),
('Eve Wang', 58000.00, 2);
```

3. **Create departments table for joining example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);
```

4. **Insert dummy data into departments table:**
```sql
INSERT INTO departments (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES
(1, 'Engineering'),
(2, 'Marketing'),
(3, 'Finance');
```

### Tasks:
1. Write a SQL query to insert a new department into the departments table only if the department with dept_id = 4 does not already exist.
2. Write a SQL query to retrieve the total salary expenses for each department from the employees table, joined with the departments table.
3. Update the salary of all employees in the employees table who belong to the 'Engineering' department by increasing their salary by 5%.
4. Write a SQL statement to delete the employees table from the database.
5. Write a SQL statement to drop the ACM21DOC database.
